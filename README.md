# Project-Managed

Inspired by years as an IT project manager, I conceptualized and created a web-application that helps users automate tedious project management tasks.
The main goal: Simplfy PM processes, and allow PMs to use their time focused on overarching project goals, instead of stuck in email.

Technologies Used: PHP, SQL, PHPmailer (SMTP), PDF API, Rich-Text Editor, jQuery, BootStrap, HTML/CSS

<b>Quick Walkthrough:</b>

- Your homepage is the Dashboard:
  <ul>
    <li> <b>Active Meetings</b> - shows upcoming meetings you own & ones that you're invited to. From here you can sort on each column to easily find information and also:
      <ul>
        <li>Access meeting notes</li>
        <li>Edit the agenda directly before or during the meeting</li>
        <li>Send out email followups with the click of one button</li>
        <li>Keep track of recurring meetings</li>
        <li>Archive old meetings</li>
      </ul>
    <li> <b>New Meeting</b> - allows you to create new agendas/add new meeting participants. From here you can also email out a link to the agenda for all included particpants to see, or create a PDF.</li>
    <li> <b>Archive</b>- allows you to clean clutter from your homepage, while still having access to older agenda notes.</li>
    <li> <b>Followups</b> - allows you to automate and track upcoming followups that you own, thanks to followups documented in earlier meeting notes.</li>
  </ul>
